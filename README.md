# PRIME FEEDBACK PROJECT!

This project collects feedbacks from student in four different views.  Each will assess on a scale of 1-5 how well the student feels after the day was over, how well they understood the content, if they were supported by the Prime staff, and finally if they wish to add any additional comments.

### HOW IT WORKS?

- Make sure to open the project in visual code or a text editor of your choosing.
- Open two terminals or ctr + t as the keyboard shortcut.
- npm run client
- npm run server
- You will start the feedback forum on localhost:3000/#/ asking "How you are feeling today?"
- localhost:3000/#/1 "How well are you understanding the content"
- localhost:3000/#/2 "How well are you being supported"
- localhost:3000/#/3 "Any comments you want to leave"
- localhost:3000/#/4 "Thank You"
- You will have the option to leave a new feedback if you wish.
- SUCCESS! You have left a feedback!
- localhost:3000/#/5 is where the the data will be store in table format.  Only the admin will have access to this page to review.
